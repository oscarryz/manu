It is cloudy. </p><p>I want to write about how my last few weeks have gone, all the learnings and experiences, that while scarce, are significant. I’ve had many new “first-time” things happen and there have been many stressors I have gone through, but there are so many that it’s not very clear which topic to choose, nor is there anything I haven’t already written about. <br /><br />I had my first rain shower in The Netherlands though. The summer is over, the weather changed so drastically, almost comical. So far the cold is not that bad, but I’ve been told it gets worse. </p><p>Also, in the last few weeks I had to do serious work with “AI” for coding on a side project that had stagnated for years. Very interesting results so far.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>But it’s cloudy. It’s cold. And it is just a Saturday morning, so I am not going to write about any of that. </p>
