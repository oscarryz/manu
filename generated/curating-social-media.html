                <div id="context-text" class="content"><h1>Curating social media</h1><h5>July 2nd, 2020</h5><p>There’s <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/antisocial-media-60ebd9250e?commentId=-MAm-HJB318OskEhU6mZ">this post</a> on indie hackers about how social media is currently more about trying to get people’s attention to what you think they might like:</p><blockquote><p> <em>On Facebook, you show others what you think they'll like. You spend time picking the best photo, edit your text to be snappy, agonize over the feedback you <strong>might</strong> get[…] I think that could be a remedy for the ills of social media - antisocial media. Time with oneself. Curating an environment... for you.</em></p></blockquote><p>A similar topic was addressed in this blog <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/websites-and-complexity">Websites and complexity</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>At the same time though, it makes me kinda sad to see people giving up ownership of their web presence. Personal websites are a mirror of the human beings behind them.</em></p></blockquote><p><br />Makes me wonder; How many of the 2.2 billion (2,200+ million) users of Facebook are interested in customizing their profile and content to make it truly unique? I guess that many, I mean most of us don’t even post original content, we just repost what someone else’s did.</p><p>I know carrd.co offers a service to create your own web page. Let’s do a Google search. Oh wow, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:carrd.co">200k results</a>!! That’s quite a number. I guess there’s some interest after all. <br />That’s still the 0.01 percent  of the Facebook users, but then again, how many of them know about carrd.co?</p><p>The other aspect people might be interested on, is curating the content (not so much the appearance of the site) to keep track of their thoughts, photos, memories. Personal things. I don’t think there’s much out there except for all those note-taking apps and document management. Let’s see.</p><p>According to <a href="https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/evernote-statistics/">this site</a>, there are 225 million Evernote users (obviously many of them are probably inactive, like the account I created years ago) that’s about 11 percent of Facebook users. Not bad at all.</p><p>Well it looks like people are indeed interested. It’s just mainstream social media is more prevalent and easier to use.</p><p>So, it seems people are willing to curate their content and tune the appearance of their profiles/sites after all.</p><p>Certainly, a topic to keep researching on.</p>
