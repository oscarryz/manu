      "content_html": "<h1>A year of remote working</h1><h6>May 13, 2021</h6><p>I always wanted to do remote work, since the days I had to commute 4-5 hrs a day, every single day for years and years, the only thing I could think of was to move away from that. </p><p>Then I’ve got a job where I had to commute 10 minutes (20 total) it was like a dream. That’s all fine and good, absolutely no complaints there. I even started to ride my bicycle to the office and sometimes I walked. </p><p>Then the lockdown forced us to do remote work. I always wanted to try and even did some while having to be away from home for a couple of weeks, but I always heard about the perils of it; distractions, lack of boundaries, lack of communication. Fortunately for me none of that happened and was the opposite. I get distracted when there's a lot of conversations around me, I suffer from involuntary eavesdropping-ism :P aggravated by the fact, sometimes those conversations turn into important work-related information that was easy to miss if you're not paying attention constantly. Also, I liked to stay after office hours to play a few games to decompress but more than once I stayed way longer than I should. That's all gone with the remote work. </p><p>Now I wake up and I'm at my desk in ... well less than a minute. Also, the communication has improved as all the work-related information has to be delivered by e-mail or chat, or in a conference call and you're explicitly summoned and waited for, and if you're gone for that day there's usually a way to catch up. So during the day, I'm able to focus on my work. If I have a question I can ask or call one of my coworkers without having to check if they're at their desk. If they're not available they'll reply eventually, or if busy they just won't reply. Unlike the person to person where it's a bit awkward when someone is busy and can't help you at the moment or the other way around, you're busy and someone shows up at your desk and you feel bad to tell them you’re busy. Now you just put your do-not-disturb sign the the chat. As for drawing the line between work / home times, we have been very good at saying good night at the end of the day so there's a clear boundary when you have to stop working. </p><p>Do I miss the social interaction? Yes. A bit, but I realized I was the reserved type anyway, or rather, I'm fine being reserved. </p><h3>Next step?</h3><p>Now I know we're living in exceptional circumstances, but can't help to imagine a time where remote work is the norm and you can live anywhere. I'm starting to daydream about living in other countries, one month at a time. Working during the week (albeit in probably weird hours due to the timezones difference) and  during the weekend get to visit the surrounding area. </p>\n",

But when things that are under our control go bad the feeling is terrible. We should remember not to be too harsh with ourselves in those situations either, this is how life is.</p><p>Better is to recognize the mistake as soon as possible, it might be hard especially when the ego is involved. Also as soon as we admit the responsibility for the fault it’s very useful to try to find out what’s the underlying reason for the mistake instead of just degrade ourselves thinking we are stupid or worthless, that’s not helpful at all.</p><p>Eventually, things will turn around, they always do, the trick is to try to create the conditions for the good things to extend as much as possible and endure the bad times while they last, learn from the mistakes, and move on.

      "content_html": "<h1>The best time of my life</h1><p>I have been very fortunate and many ways, and this lockdown has given me opportunities I never had before, namely work from home.</p><p>At the end of the workday, I just walk out of the room I use as an office and I’m instantly at home, my commute was already good, but at some point in my life it was taking me up to 3 hrs each way, needless to say, I switched jobs.</p><p>There are some distractions having the family so close, but I would argue there were some (albeit different) distractions in my workplace when people around start chatting (even if it was work-related). At home, we have managed to keep the distractions at a minimum and my employer has been awesome in allowing us to have extra time off when required during these special circumstances.</p><p>My family is healthy, I am healthy although I had recently spent some time in the hospital due to what I thought was a stroke, which turned to be a number of things combined (migraine, arm numbness) that looked like one. I’m glad to know it wasn’t as serious but definitely gave me the wake-up shake that I needed to go back and being active and eat healthier.</p><p>I have found love, and what an awesome person did I find. Sometimes when there is some struggle I tell her “Well don’t blame me, I chose wisely, you not so much” but of course I try to improve on whatever we were struggling with, for instance among other things, cook more often, who would’ve thought cooking was so easy and rewarding. <br /><br />Anyway, I know I’m really privileged and there are a lot of people that are struggling. Yet I think it’s important to stop for a second and be grateful for what you have and enjoy the moment and this is what this post is all about.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<h1>Social Networks power</h1><p>There have been some concerns about how much power do social networks have, and if people should abandon them or not, and also move to where exactly.</p><p>Some other voices disregard these concerns with “Well they already know everything about me” or “Social Networks only care about famous people, not simpletons like you”. None of these arguments are valid.</p><p>I don’t think that’s the problem here. It’s very unlikely and impractical to try to go back to a previous era where these things didn’t exist. Some communities have tried to isolate themselves from modern society and the problems it brings (I think about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish\">Amish</a>), but let’s be realistic, that’s not going to happen.</p><p>I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and wiser but, I’ve seen this before, with the T.V. while the differences are notable the same principle can be followed; educate yourself and your family on how much exposure is healthy, how many hours do you need to be on the device (t.v., or phones, or in this case Social Networks), and how much is too much. Another example is any kind of addiction if you stop doing X activity for spending all your time doing Y, you have an addiction problem.</p><p>So I think it’s a matter of education, I see in the future kids will get a class on social media just like today (most) get Sexual Education.</p><p>So, don’t abandon them or move to some other platform. They are a very good tool if used properly (never before like today we’ve been able to get so much information so quickly or to be face to face with someone in an instant just like we used to see in the SciFi shows in the ’80s). Treat them as you would treat a stranger (because that’s exactly that it is, a window for a stranger to peek in your life), don’t overshare your life, don’t share your personal information, don’t tell them who your family is and all your details to someone you don’t even know.</p><p>Yes, they need to be regulated and it will take some time before that happens, in the meantime, keep using them wisely to keep in contact with your friends and family for that’s what I think is the best use of them.</p>\n",

What we think is obvious might not be for others.

      "content_html": "<h1>Star gazing</h1><h5>August 13th, 2am</h5><p>It took me three days but finally today I was able to watch shooting stars.</p><p>I grew up in a place where going out after 8pm requires you to wear a sweater, no matter the time of the year, and definitely at least three layers after midnight. Now I live in Texas and my brain struggles to understand it's 30C (86f) at 2 am. I for one am glad as I could pull a chair in the garden and layback to watch the sky.</p><p>Now, when they say “meteor shower” what comes to mind? Meteorites falling as rain, am I right? Nothing even close. But definitely much more than what one could expect to see by just turning your head up to the sky.</p><p>It's a fun experience, at the beginning it's confusing, you're there and absolutely nothing happens. Then the night sounds started to freak me out, the wind blowing in the trees, the crickets, the creaking on the neighbor fence, and even the AC turning on and off make me wanted to run back into the house. Then it hits me, all of these things still happen without me while I’m sleeping. These night things welcome me into their world by just ignoring me and accepting me as I am.</p><p>So I relax a bit and start to feel comfortable, but still nothing happens. Then there it is! A first shooting star, although I immediately start wondering if I imagined it, it was way too brief and too dim, nothing like some others I’ve seen before. Oh well.</p><p>20 minutes in, check my phone app to see (for the 10th time) where the perseids are located and while I’m moving my sight into the screen I see another one, very clear! very bright!. Ok ok, put the phone away and get ready to be amazed by the rest of the stars. Nothing happens.</p><p>So, things start getting a bit uncomfortable, I’m wearing pants and a long sleeve in 30c (86f) weather due to the mosquitoes, so I’m sweating a bit. My hands (the only uncovered part besides my face) start getting a bit itchy, a mosquito must have found it’s way there. I’m starting to worry about the possibility of having the chair in the middle of an ant “house”, and I’ve just seen 1 1/2 star.</p><p>“Come on! where are they?” I ask myself knowing (but not accepting) that I need to be patient. I take a conscious deep breath and realize all of this is part of the experience, the being in the middle of the yard , in the dark, my head leaning back. So I cover my hands a bit more, lay back and enjoy the moment. I hear the same night sounds but now they’re just like a lullaby, the cracking on the fence it’s not scary anymore, it’s just a rhythmic sound. The wind on the trees, which is a sound I adore in the day, it’s even delightful in the night. I hear some dogs barking very far away and I compare them to those where I grew up. There are some other sounds whose source I cannot fully detect but they’re fine I stop trying to figure out where they come from.</p><p>40 minutes in and finally I stopped trying to make things happen just because I want to. They’ll just happen when they have to. I just have to be present. So I start preparing my wishes for the upcoming stars as I know they’ll show up. And a few minutes later there was one, and another, and another. Some of them dim and shy, that last one I saw, about the brightest I’ve ever seen, 4 seconds crossing the sky.</p><p>One hour after and many wishes for all my loved ones after, I walk back to the house. The moon is about to show up and Illuminate the sky. Went  into the house and enjoyed all the other things that sleep in there.</p><p>This has been a very nice star gazing night.</p>\n",

In that case, that wouldn't be a problem and would be the rare case of someone who found what they want to do for the rest of their life. The reality, however, is not that simple.

In the past , society has enforced stereotypes in which only the positive should be promoted and the negative suppressed. This is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=toxic+positivity\" title=\"\">toxic positivity</a> and even when well-intentioned it causes more damage than what it tries to help.</p><p>These “negative” feelings are also part of ourselves, and we cannot just ignore them and push them aside. For one, that would be denying our own human nature; secondly, they will find their way in sometimes unpredictable ways; and finally, they’re there for a reason, either to create awareness of our surroundings, serving as an alert, to stop doing something that’s damaging us, or enabling us to feel empathy and create a connection with others.</p>",

Never posted anything beyond the “hello world”.</p><p>I wasn't until I built this blog “engine” myself from the ground up that I get to use it, and I mean, really built it, no Gatsby, Jekyll, or static generators. Pure string concatenation (not saying this is good, but wanted to experiment how to do it).</p><p>There's no likes, analytics, comments, share button or alike (maybe I'll add those later). Just a link to my twitter in case someone wants to DM a reply, but that's not the intention.</p><p>I have it as a (really messy) <a href=\"https://github.com/oscarryz/manu\" title=\"Manu in Github\">open source project</a> and keep learning while I build it (e.g. yesterday added support to toggle dark mode).</p><p>There's something special about crafting your stuff, I guess similar to when we used to build our bows and arrows; if they suck you suck, but you can go home and improve them. When they work you feel proud. That's something we've lost in our technological evolution and yet so innate to human nature, it still finds its way in such an abstract world like the Internet.</p>",

You spend time picking the best photo, edit your text to be snappy, agonize over the feedback you&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>&nbsp;get[…] I think that could be a remedy for the ills of social media - antisocial media. Time with oneself. Curating an environment... for you.</em></p></blockquote><p>A similar topic was addressed in this blog&nbsp;<a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/websites-and-complexity\">Websites and complexity</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>At the same time though, it makes me kinda sad to see people giving up ownership of their web presence. Personal websites are a mirror of the human beings behind them.</em></p></blockquote><p><br>Makes me wonder; How many of the 2.2 billion (2,200+ million) users of Facebook are interested in customizing their profile and content to make it truly unique? I guess that many, I mean most of us don’t even post original content, we just repost what someone else’s did.</p><p>I know&nbsp;carrd.co&nbsp;offers a service to create your own web page. Let’s do a Google search. Oh wow,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site:carrd.co\">200k results</a>!! That’s quite a number. I guess there’s some interest after all.&nbsp;<br>That’s still the 0.01 percent&nbsp; of the Facebook users, but then again, how many of them know about carrd.co?</p><p>The other aspect people might be interested on, is curating the content (not so much the appearance of the site) to keep track of their thoughts, photos, memories. Personal things. I don’t think there’s much out there except for all those note-taking apps and document management. Let’s see.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/evernote-statistics/\">this site</a>, there are 225 million Evernote users (obviously many of them are probably inactive, like the account I created years ago) that’s about 11 percent of Facebook users. Not bad at all.</p><p>Well it looks like people are indeed interested. It’s just mainstream social media is more prevalent and easier to use.</p><p>So, it seems people are willing to curate their content and tune the appearance of their profiles/sites after all.</p><p>Certainly, a topic to keep researching on.</p>",

I personally don't blog that often (or if at all) The thinking of having to conform to \"conventional\" practices and adhere to certain style creates a bit of anxiety in me. What if what I'm writing is seems boring? What if my grammar is terrible? What if the content is all over the place?</p><p>Fortunately I came across this blog <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\" title=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\">manuelmoreale.com</a> which is is a great source of inspiration for a different type social media content. Way simpler, no SEO goals, personal.</p><p>I also can relate to the \"graveyard\" folder situation. Many projects started and never finished because of lack of time and/or lack of definition of a MVP.</p><p>So, as a way of applying what I've learned in IH about creating and MVP and keep it minimum I created a clone of <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\" title=\"manuelmoreale.com/\">manuelmorale.com</a> blog, but this one could be edited <em>in situ</em>. Unfortunately I also wanted to experiment with \"extreme\" serverlessness and the editor only runs locally and publishes the generated static site, so no online demo, only the final output: <a href=\"https://manu.oscarryz.com/\" title=\"https://manu.oscarryz.com/\">https://manu.oscarryz.com/</a></p><p>So that's my MVP for the same goal as yours, create something for myself.</p><p>I'm sorry if I'm just talking about myself. What I meant to say with all of this, is yes! I like your idea and I'm myself going to keep exploring on these different ways to do things.</p>",
