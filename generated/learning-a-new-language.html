                <h1>Learning a new language</h1><p>It’s been a while since I learn a new language… well the only other language I actually can say I know, which is English. <br /><br />I learned in a very long long period of time. I’m almost certain I took two months of classes every 4-5 years and in each enrollment, I “untangled” all the misunderstandings I’ve built in the previous years. It concluded with a 6 months period of advanced classes (1.5 hrs every other day… a 7 am class ugh) Anyway, from then on I was certain I knew English (I’ve got a certificate saying I do)  and didn’t really use it consistently for a while. You know… like many other kinds of knowledge. I used to read technical articles  for sure, and I started to ignore the subtitles in the American movies, but not quite.</p><p>And then… I moved to the USA for a job, needless to say, full English, oh my. I managed the interview, not really sure how, I just remember at the end of the 5 hrs long my head was hurting. On my first day on the job, everybody was considerate enough that English was my second language, and the next day, they treated me like I have been living there for years. They were some difficult years I tell ya that. I could understand everything or most everything but it was hard to express myself with fluency especially in technical discussions when there were so many concepts, abbreviations (oh dear, American English - not sure if the same happens in the UK - love to abbreviate everything in TLA, three-letter acronyms)  Binge watching all seasons of HIMYM helped… a lot.<br /><br />Then we have the inconsistency  of written English, but to be fair, I learned the language had a hard uprising, first, a Germanic language changed a lot with Latin during Roman rule, then (or before that?) the Vikings added their portion, and then French finished the mayhem. Anyway, for months I pronounced things like “Ah vo kei doh” for Avocado or “Wa ee nd” for " Wind”  without anyone correcting me, perhaps being courteous and patient with me. Or I kept using the sound “Jey” for the letter “Y”  (as expected in a Spanish speaker) because nobody told us it doesn’t have the Jey sound, but an “I” sound.  So here I am saying “jes” and “jellow” causing some chuckles. And don’t even get me started with the Beach or the Sheet, because I still double and triple check my pronunciation before utter saying those two. </p><p>I solved those and many other problems with time and practice. And definitely I was fortunate to meet a language pathologist specializing in Accent Reduction, she had a meet-up to chat and correct these kinds of problems. Now with COVID the meetings are still happening virtually and she started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRQHJ9wrTvKPKpsTh6tnfQ">YouTube Channel</a>. <br /><br />Today I can say my struggles with the language are not too different from a native speaker, I still have to check how a new word is pronounced and / or just ask people to repeat themselves if I don’t understand them. </p><h3>Ah yes a new language</h3><p>Ehem, well I was going to post how now I’m learning a new language for the first time in years, and it turned into this semi-ranting about my struggles with English. </p><p>I started 24 days ago, to learn Dutch (!?) using Duolingo. Why Dutch? Well this post is already too long, I’ll just say it’s easier than German and more real than Esperanto. </p><p>The experience has been really pleasant and while I know it would take me years before I’m fluent the other day I had that moment of joy when I could identify some words by myself. And today I came up with a phrase while I was running: <em>Ik wil ga niet,. </em>Checked it on Google Translate and it was correct (almost).  I’ll probably write something more about that in the future. For now, I have to stop this and go and do my practice to keep my position in the Ruby league. </p><p>content</p>
