      "content_html": "<h1>The second year of remote work</h1><p>I’ve been working remotely for almost two years. </p><p>There has been a lot of <a href=\"https://oscarryz.com/a-year-of-remote-working.html\">good things about it</a>. Now in this second year I’ve noticed the main reason is the interaction I have with my team. </p><p>We’ve increased the social interaction we have; we talk more on 1:1’s, we stay longer after a meeting is over just to talk and socialize. The long-term effect is we have built trust in each other which helps when we have to solve work problems.</p><p> Our company has been very helpful in this regard, we have a budget for team events, and also we have a 1 hr per week mandatory game time (in addition to the existing ones) So, we use that time to connect.</p><p>Is very important to strengthen these connections specially when working from home and other kinds of social interaction are limited. It helps not only to do the work more efficiently but for our mental health. </p><p>Starting a conversation is much easier with a video conference. Staying longer after a meeting is easier too. There’s always the chat where we can just feel we’re not alone and we have established rules to use it properly (we use threads intensively and we summarize them when the conversation is done). There’s no need to find a conference room to get together and regardless, half of my team is 2hrs timezone difference anyway so we would’ve had to do a video conference regardless.</p><p>There has been a lot of stress about being in a constant lockdown. Many people are tired of doing so and just returned to “normality” which makes the whole pandemic last even longer. Yes, it’s hard, but we can make it easier by building connections online.</p>\n",

We like to talk to each other, use our bodies to complement what we're saying, wave our hands, raise our eyebrows, roll our eyes! We also read the other people's body language and make adjustments. When we communicate through Social Media we can't do most of those things, we use text and it tends to be limited. Nobody wants to read a text wall, at least not to have a 1 on 1 conversation. Using video conferences has immensely helped, but we still need to improve the hardware (microphones, speakers, video quality, compression, etc.) to make it similar to a real-life conversation.</p><p>Given that 1 on 1 communication is not as fluid due to these limitations, internet communication evolved into entertainment. First was sharing jokes and then illustrating them as cartoons (soon after the meme would start). Videos make it easier to express ourselves and then we start looking more at our internet devices than TV. </p><p>TV shows and films are slowly decaying. They might always exist, just like we thought books would die but they are still around. But most of the show business has moved into the internet. And that even improved the entertainment we've got. It democratized the production of such entertainment, now all you need to start is a smartphone and a computer whereas before you had to knock on tv producers' doors or wait to be discovered. Even advertisements improved, we've got shorter targeted commercials (I know the targeted part is controversial, but at least they are not completely irrelevant).</p><p>Either way, it seems like the kind of entertainment we've got used to in the 20th century is going away and Social Media is taking its place. We have yet to see if it can finally be turned into a tool for good or it will keep dumbing us down as its predecessor. </p>\n",

Even the introduction of upvoting posts solved the problem forums themselves brought: too much content!</p><p>But along this desire to connect and share with other humans came another very human trait: to be liked. Furthermore, when the platforms that are running ads next to the content noticed the more liked  a post is  more the revenue, they tweaked and fine-tuned the content up to the point where we no longer see just things other people with our similar interest share. We now see topics we were not even interested in initially. And the pushing for more viral content favors content that is in many cases divisive. </p><p>There have been some attempts to solve this problem.

      "title": "Learning a new language",
      "content_html": "<h1>Learning a new language</h1><p>It’s been a while since I learn a new language… the only other language I actually can say I know is English. <br /><br />I learned it in a very long period of time. I took classes for two months every 4-5 years and in each enrollment, I “untangled” all the misunderstandings I’ve built in the previous years. It concluded with a 6 months period of advanced classes (1.5 hrs every other day… a 7 am class ugh) Anyway, from then on I was certain I knew English (I’ve got a certificate saying I do) and didn’t really use it consistently for a while.</p><p>It was like with many other kinds of knowledge, it’s there, you use it once in a while. I used to read technical articles, and I started to ignore the subtitles in the American movies at some point, but not quite.</p><p>And then… I moved to the USA for a job, needless to say, it was a full English immersion , oh my.</p><p>On my first day on the job, everybody was very considerate knowing English was my second language, but the next day, they treated me like if I have been living there for years. Those were some difficult years I tell ya that. I could understand everything or mostly everything but it was hard to express myself with fluency especially in technical discussions when there were so many concepts, abbreviations (oh dear, American English, I’m not sure if the same happens in the UK but here we love to abbreviate everything in TLA, three-letter acronyms).</p><p> Binge watching all seasons of HIMYM helped… a lot.<br /><br />Then we have the inconsistency of written English, but to be fair, I learned the language had a hard uprising ( see more about that in the video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqLiRu34kWo\">Why English Spelling is so Damn Weird</a> ).</p><p>Anyway, for months I pronounced things like “Ah-vo-kei-doh” for Avocado or “W-ee-nd” for \" Wind” without anyone correcting me, perhaps they were being courteous and patient with me. Also I kept using the sound “Jay” for the letter “Y” (as expected in a Spanish speaker) because nobody told me it doesn’t have the Jay sound, but an “I” sound. So here I am saying “jes” and “jellow” causing some chuckles. And don’t even get me started with the words Beach or Sheet, because I still double and triple check my pronunciation before uttering those two.</p><p>I solved those and many other problems with time and practice. And definitely I was fortunate to meet a language pathologist specializing in Accent Reduction, she had a meet-up to chat and correct these kinds of problems. Now with COVID the meetings are still happening virtually and she started a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRQHJ9wrTvKPKpsTh6tnfQ\">YouTube Channel</a>. <br /><br />Today I can say my struggles with the language are not too different from a native speaker, I still have to check how a new word is pronounced and / or just ask people to repeat themselves if I don’t understand them. I think most of the time in English and dream from time to time when the dream has dialog in that language too, although my dreams are very abstract so, I’m not so sure language takes place there, but that’s a different post.</p><h3>Ah yes a new language</h3><p>Ehem, well I was going to post how now I’m learning a new language for the first time in years, and it turned into this semi-ranting about my struggles with English.</p><p>I started 24 days ago, to learn Dutch (!?) using Duolingo. Why Dutch? Well this post is already too long, I’ll just say it’s easier than German and more real than Esperanto.</p><p>The experience has been really pleasant so far and while I know it would take me years before I’m fluent the other day I had that moment of joy when I could identify some words by myself. And today I came up with a phrase while I was running: <em>Ik wil ga niet. </em>I checked it on Google Translate and it was correct (almost). I’ll probably write something more about that in the future. For now, I have to stop this and go and do my practice to keep my position in the Ruby league.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<h1>A year of remote working</h1><h6>May 13, 2021</h6><p>I always wanted to do remote work, since the days I had to commute 4-5 hrs a day, every single day for years and years, the only thing I could think of was to move away from that. </p><p>Then I’ve got a job where I had to commute 10 minutes (20 total) it was like a dream. That’s all fine and good, absolutely no complaints there. I even started to ride my bicycle to the office and sometimes I walked. </p><p>Then the lockdown forced us to do remote work. I always wanted to try and even did some while having to be away from home for a couple of weeks, but I always heard about the perils of it; distractions, lack of boundaries, lack of communication. Fortunately for me none of that happened and was the opposite. I get distracted when there's a lot of conversations around me, I suffer from involuntary eavesdropping-ism :P aggravated by the fact, sometimes those conversations turn into important work-related information that was easy to miss if you're not paying attention constantly. Also, I liked to stay after office hours to play a few games to decompress but more than once I stayed way longer than I should. That's all gone with the remote work. </p><p>Now I wake up and I'm at my desk in ... well less than a minute. Also, the communication has improved as all the work-related information has to be delivered by e-mail or chat, or in a conference call and you're explicitly summoned and waited for, and if you're gone for that day there's usually a way to catch up. So during the day, I'm able to focus on my work. If I have a question I can ask or call one of my coworkers without having to check if they're at their desk. If they're not available they'll reply eventually, or if busy they just won't reply. Unlike the person to person where it's a bit awkward when someone is busy and can't help you at the moment or the other way around, you're busy and someone shows up at your desk and you feel bad to tell them you’re busy. Now you just put your do-not-disturb sign the the chat. As for drawing the line between work / home times, we have been very good at saying good night at the end of the day so there's a clear boundary when you have to stop working. </p><p>Do I miss the social interaction? Yes. A bit, but I realized I was the reserved type anyway, or rather, I'm fine being reserved. </p><h3>Next step?</h3><p>Now I know we're living in exceptional circumstances, but can't help to imagine a time where remote work is the norm and you can live anywhere. I'm starting to daydream about living in other countries, one month at a time. Working during the week (albeit in probably weird hours due to the timezones difference) and  during the weekend get to visit the surrounding area. </p>\n",

But when things that are under our control go bad the feeling is terrible. We should remember not to be too harsh with ourselves in those situations either, this is how life is.</p><p>Better is to recognize the mistake as soon as possible, it might be hard especially when the ego is involved. Also as soon as we admit the responsibility for the fault it’s very useful to try to find out what’s the underlying reason for the mistake instead of just degrade ourselves thinking we are stupid or worthless, that’s not helpful at all.</p><p>Eventually, things will turn around, they always do, the trick is to try to create the conditions for the good things to extend as much as possible and endure the bad times while they last, learn from the mistakes, and move on.

At home, we have managed to keep the distractions at a minimum and my employer has been awesome in allowing us to have extra time off when required during these special circumstances.</p><p>My family is healthy, I am healthy although I had recently spent some time in the hospital due to what I thought was a stroke, which turned to be a number of things combined (migraine, arm numbness) that looked like one. I’m glad to know it wasn’t as serious but definitely gave me the wake-up shake that I needed to go back and being active and eat healthier.</p><p>I have found love, and what an awesome person did I find. Sometimes when there is some struggle I tell her “Well don’t blame me, I chose wisely, you not so much” but of course I try to improve on whatever we were struggling with, for instance among other things, cook more often, who would’ve thought cooking was so easy and rewarding. <br /><br />Anyway, I know I’m really privileged and there are a lot of people that are struggling.

None of these arguments are valid.</p><p>I don’t think that’s the problem here. It’s very unlikely and impractical to try to go back to a previous era where these things didn’t exist. Some communities have tried to isolate themselves from modern society and the problems it brings (I think about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish\">Amish</a>), but let’s be realistic, that’s not going to happen.</p><p>I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and wiser but, I’ve seen this before, with the T.V. while the differences are notable the same principle can be followed; educate yourself and your family on how much exposure is healthy, how many hours do you need to be on the device (t.v., or phones, or in this case Social Networks), and how much is too much. Another example is any kind of addiction if you stop doing X activity for spending all your time doing Y, you have an addiction problem.</p><p>So I think it’s a matter of education, I see in the future kids will get a class on social media just like today (most) get Sexual Education.</p><p>So, don’t abandon them or move to some other platform. They are a very good tool if used properly (never before like today we’ve been able to get so much information so quickly or to be face to face with someone in an instant just like we used to see in the SciFi shows in the ’80s). Treat them as you would treat a stranger (because that’s exactly that it is, a window for a stranger to peek in your life), don’t overshare your life, don’t share your personal information, don’t tell them who your family is and all your details to someone you don’t even know.</p><p>Yes, they need to be regulated and it will take some time before that happens, in the meantime, keep using them wisely to keep in contact with your friends and family for that’s what I think is the best use of them.</p>\n",

Then the night sounds started to freak me out, the wind blowing in the trees, the crickets, the creaking on the neighbor fence, and even the AC turning on and off make me wanted to run back into the house. Then it hits me, all of these things still happen without me while I’m sleeping. These night things welcome me into their world by just ignoring me and accepting me as I am.</p><p>So I relax a bit and start to feel comfortable, but still nothing happens. Then there it is! A first shooting star, although I immediately start wondering if I imagined it, it was way too brief and too dim, nothing like some others I’ve seen before. Oh well.</p><p>20 minutes in, check my phone app to see (for the 10th time) where the perseids are located and while I’m moving my sight into the screen I see another one, very clear! very bright!. Ok ok, put the phone away and get ready to be amazed by the rest of the stars. Nothing happens.</p><p>So, things start getting a bit uncomfortable, I’m wearing pants and a long sleeve in 30c (86f) weather due to the mosquitoes, so I’m sweating a bit. My hands (the only uncovered part besides my face) start getting a bit itchy, a mosquito must have found it’s way there. I’m starting to worry about the possibility of having the chair in the middle of an ant “house”, and I’ve just seen 1 1/2 star.</p><p>“Come on! where are they?” I ask myself knowing (but not accepting) that I need to be patient. I take a conscious deep breath and realize all of this is part of the experience, the being in the middle of the yard , in the dark, my head leaning back. So I cover my hands a bit more, lay back and enjoy the moment. I hear the same night sounds but now they’re just like a lullaby, the cracking on the fence it’s not scary anymore, it’s just a rhythmic sound. The wind on the trees, which is a sound I adore in the day, it’s even delightful in the night. I hear some dogs barking very far away and I compare them to those where I grew up. There are some other sounds whose source I cannot fully detect but they’re fine I stop trying to figure out where they come from.</p><p>40 minutes in and finally I stopped trying to make things happen just because I want to. They’ll just happen when they have to. I just have to be present. So I start preparing my wishes for the upcoming stars as I know they’ll show up. And a few minutes later there was one, and another, and another. Some of them dim and shy, that last one I saw, about the brightest I’ve ever seen, 4 seconds crossing the sky.</p><p>One hour after and many wishes for all my loved ones after, I walk back to the house. The moon is about to show up and Illuminate the sky. Went  into the house and enjoyed all the other things that sleep in there.</p><p>This has been a very nice star gazing night.</p>\n",

In this case, not sleeping all day would make us better. What if, we insist, that sleeping is what we want to do. In that case, that wouldn't be a problem and would be the rare case of someone who found what they want to do for the rest of their life. The reality, however, is not that simple. We need to do something else (go to work to buy food, make food, eat, etc.).</p><p>That's why good habits, like sleep well, healthy food, exercise, among many others, are deemed as good things as they enable us to enjoy life better, a healthy, well-slept body will enjoy a sunset better than one with sleep deprivation.</p><p>When we become self-sufficient, we enable ourselves to give us more opportunities to enjoy life (making yourself your favorite food is an example).</p><p>That's why I think we should try to be better persons because, in the end, it benefits ourselves.

Personal websites are a mirror of the human beings behind them.</em></p></blockquote><p><br>Makes me wonder; How many of the 2.2 billion (2,200+ million) users of Facebook are interested in customizing their profile and content to make it truly unique? I guess that many, I mean most of us don’t even post original content, we just repost what someone else’s did.</p><p>I know&nbsp;carrd.co&nbsp;offers a service to create your own web page. Let’s do a Google search. Oh wow,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site:carrd.co\">200k results</a>!! That’s quite a number. I guess there’s some interest after all.&nbsp;<br>That’s still the 0.01 percent&nbsp; of the Facebook users, but then again, how many of them know about carrd.co?</p><p>The other aspect people might be interested on, is curating the content (not so much the appearance of the site) to keep track of their thoughts, photos, memories. Personal things. I don’t think there’s much out there except for all those note-taking apps and document management. Let’s see.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/evernote-statistics/\">this site</a>, there are 225 million Evernote users (obviously many of them are probably inactive, like the account I created years ago) that’s about 11 percent of Facebook users. Not bad at all.</p><p>Well it looks like people are indeed interested. It’s just mainstream social media is more prevalent and easier to use.</p><p>So, it seems people are willing to curate their content and tune the appearance of their profiles/sites after all.</p><p>Certainly, a topic to keep researching on.</p>",

Unfortunately I also wanted to experiment with \"extreme\" serverlessness and the editor only runs locally and publishes the generated static site, so no online demo, only the final output: <a href=\"https://manu.oscarryz.com/\" title=\"https://manu.oscarryz.com/\">https://manu.oscarryz.com/</a></p><p>So that's my MVP for the same goal as yours, create something for myself.</p><p>I'm sorry if I'm just talking about myself. What I meant to say with all of this, is yes! I like your idea and I'm myself going to keep exploring on these different ways to do things.</p>",

It wasn’t particularly hard, just a little bit cumbersome, mostly due the lack of time.</p><p>So, taking as “inspiration” the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\">https://manuelmoreale.com/</a>&nbsp;blog, we came up with this “design”:</p><p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscarryz/manu/master/etc/Editor-View.png\" alt=\"Editor view of the blog platform\" title=\"Manu blog platform\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\">Which is basically the same ui but adding an editor bar to create new entries, edit them and publish them.</p><p>I’ll keep documenting the approach we took to write this down and how far we’ve got. This right here is the first entry on the working platform, and while still far from complete is now usable.</p>",
