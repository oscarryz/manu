                <div id="context-text" class="content"><h1>Life updates!</h1><p>It has been a while since the last post… I don’t even remember when was that. <br /><br />The past few months have been a little bit crazy, good crazy. We decided to move countries, and start applying for jobs, I applied to everything available in the Netherlands. A few week later I got a job offer that I accepted. <br /><br />Then the task to find a house for rent started, tldr; it was hard. </p><p>A month ago (mid June 2025) we finally moved-in, and the “Learn all the things” process started. So far the move while challenging it also has been really pleasant.  The Netherlands is a very nice country, its people have been very welcoming and this was my first week on my new job (second week if we count orientation).</p><p>It's been a long journey, starting with picking a country to move to, then sending out CVs and getting interviews. After that, it was all about finding a place to live, selling everything you own, and then buying it all again. Then came learning the ropes, like how to take the train or ride a bike to commute, and finally, meeting tons of new people and trying to remember all their names!</p><p>I just want to write this down to express gratitude for having this opportunity, and to note that while life seems (and is) intimidating, it is also very exciting. </p>
