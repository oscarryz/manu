                <div id="context-text" class="content"><h1>Life updates!</h1><p>It has been a while since the last post… I don’t even remember when was that. <br /><br />The past few months have been a little bit crazy, good crazy. I decided to move countries, and start applying for jobs, I applied to everything and everywhere available in the Netherlands. A few week later I got a job offer that I accepted. <br /><br />Then the task to find a house for rent started, tldr it was hard. </p><p>A month ago (mid June 2025) we finally moved and started the “Learn all the things” process. So far the move while challenging (starting from finding a house, sell most of your belongings, pack and ship the rest, going all the way to getting into a new house and furnish it and everything in between) has been really pleasant.  The Netherlands is a very nice country, its people have been very welcoming and this was my first week on my new job (second week if we count orientation).</p><p>I just want to write this down to express gratitude for being able to do this, and while life seems (and is) intimidating, and also very exciting. </p>
