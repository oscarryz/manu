                <div id="context-text" class="content"><h1>Flawless Execution</h1><p>I recently came to the realization that I'm a perfectionist. I think that has an origin more related to self-criticism than an actual desire for flawless outcomes, which, unless you're doing something really simple, don't come by very often.</p><p>My first memory of thinking I was doing something wrong was in pre-K. I was probably 4 years old. I couldn't cut a piece of paper following a path. Let alone following a path, I couldn't cut it at all; the sheet just folded in my hands. Nobody told me then (or later) the reason I couldn't use scissors is that I'm left-handed. Years later, I found a better way to cut paper: folding it, sharpening a crest with my nails, and then just tearing it off. Almost a perfect result if you let go of the fact that there's a bit of loose soft paper right at the edge. That's fine.</p><p>Now I know that perfection, while enticing, is not as constructive as alright or even bad execution. Mistakes are learning opportunities, while flawless execution sometimes feels like a missed opportunity as there was no learning.</p>
