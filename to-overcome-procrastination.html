                <h1>To overcome procrastination…</h1><p>Just go! </p><p>It’s simplistic and if life was as easy nobody would struggle, but after researching about the topic, all comes down to get over that the discomfort the task at hand brings, whether is to do the dishes, start homework, or do the lawn, those things won’t get done by themselves, and if you have to do them anyway, there are now two things to deal with, the first the activity itself, and the second is not the discomfort of knowing you have to do them. <br /><br />You keep passing through the pile of dishes and they’re still there, the HOA starts sending letter reminding you to do your lawn etc. Sometimes the consequences are easily visible (you don’t have any more clean plates to eat), sometimes they take a long time to materialize (I still haven’t received a 3rd HOA warning), but the fact is 98% of the time, things won’t do themselves, there’s a lucky 2% where not doing anything solve the problem, probably less. <br /><br />Once the whole root cause is understood, the why doing dishes creates X or Y mental reaction and you have consumed all the YouTube videos on how to do them easier, the only thing to do is get up, get that sponge and do them. It turns out if you do it right away it gets way easier to clean. Also if you finish all the food on the plate, it gets easier to clean too. If none of that work, just rinse them and toss them into the dishwasher. The point is, the sooner you get through the discomfort, the faster the thing gets done. And it gets even better, there’s less to worry about, less task to do (you now just have to do the dinner dishes) and starts getting easier. <br /><br />Now not all the tasks are created equal, some are super complex and/or difficult to do, but are they really? Can you ask for help? Split the gigantic task into smaller ones, or just get started and see how far can you get? </p><p>At the end the fastest, more effective and at a degree easier way to overcome procrastination is to just go and do the thing.</p><p><br /></p>
