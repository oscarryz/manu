                <h1>Where did we go so wrong?</h1><p>I’m trying to think where in the history of modern society and capitalism we got so wrong? We certainly live in the most prosperous era, there are many technological advances and life expectancy and health are better than any other time, and yet, living in a “modern” society is so hard. We spend our lives trying to save enough money to retire. We get into debt to get an education that allow us to earn more money and then we spend a lot of time pay it off.</p><p>It looks like simpler, more connected way of living is possible and brings many benefits, better quality of life, longer life expectancy, less stress; but it feels to me as unattainable as the other end, the opulent ultra rich life. The simpler life, where ideally we self-sustain and live in a small village, while ideal, it seems to put ourselves in the border of bankruptcy. <br />I was thinking this as I was reading about uncontacted human civilizations that don’t participate in this modern society. They don’t need money or any of the technological advances, in many cases it seems to bring the a better lifestyle. In our modern society, doing good, being well off,  means a to have a bigger house, to have more cars, buy more things, own more stuff,. And then we just pile  all the things up, we throw them away after a few years and buy more things we don’t even need. No wonder why in the United States the storage business is so successful, I wonder if the renting storage spaces is as big in other countries.</p><p>It is hard to grasp what’s the correct solution. I wish we were already in a time where the machines do all the work for us so we can focus on having that small village community life, where we still can be farmers but just because we want to, because we like the smell of the dew in the morning. Or where we can go and paint in the plaza after talking with our friends and go to the market to pick up fresh vegetables.</p><p>We would probably never get there. It seems this always struggling, always making money for someone else is a model that is very well established and will go for much longer. I just hope we don’t destroy the resources we need to live in an attempt to have more stuff.</p><p>Anyway, I was just thinking about that.</p>
