Minimalist Blogging Platform based on https://manuelmoreale.com/ blog because it's awesome.


(WIP)

Idea is to create a blogging platform with the followig elements:

- A WYSIWYG editor ( Use https://prosemirror.net to avoid start from scratch)
- A controller that takes what the user writes and generate the HTML
- Save the content to a flat file system (no database or remote storages)
- Deploy as static file service (Github pages or any other platform that serves static files)
