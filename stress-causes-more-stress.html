                <div id="context-text" class="content"><h1>Stress causes more stress</h1><p>I just learned one of those <em>“very obvious”</em> things, that were not so obvious until someone else said it. <br /><br />Stress is a response to a difficult situation, originally was to activate our survival instinct, the flight or fight response, that has been in our nature since before we turned into humans. </p><p>When we were wild animals, this helped us to space predators or use extra strength if it was needed, but for modern life is not of much use. This I knew for a long while. What I just learned,  is our logical/reasoning also gets affected, the more stress, the less capable of reasoning we are (thus, we are getting ready to fight .. or flight), and if the stress is caused for a situation where you have to use your brain, things can go down spiral. Because you’re not thinking clearly, the problem that is stressing you cannot be solved, and you get more stress and think less and less clearly. </p><p>For this kind of situations the possible solution to break the vicious cycle to to take break and relax, although this might seem counter intuitive, you go on the weekend and instead of relaxing you’re still thinking on that problem. So, an intermediate solution can be attempted, instead of trying to solve it by working harder, try to solve it by taking breaks, talking with someone (a rubber duckling if needed) , go for a walk, get distracted for a bit and then go back to work. Usually what has helped me is to talk to someone to whom I have to explains slowly all the things I’m trying and usually they can suggest some, even if you have tried them already. </p><p>Sometimes is hard trying to relax so the stress doesn’t go off the roof, but it might be just the right thing to do. Realize you’re not in danger (if you’re not) and the problem you’re trying to solve is an interesting one. Communicate with other so they are aware of the status of the problem and hopefully if a solution cannot be found, a workaround might emerge. </p>
